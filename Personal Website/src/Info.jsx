      <p>
        Hey there, I'm Ezechias Mulamba, born and raised in the sunny vibes of
        Cape Town, South Africa, back in 2004. From early on, I saw how tech was
        shaping our world, and after high school, I decided diving into software
        development was the way to go—it's like mastering the ultimate skill of
        our time, right? When I'm not glued to my screen coding up a storm,
        you'll often find me strumming away on my guitar, lost in music, or
        jotting down poetry that's as random and wild as life itself. Hanging
        out with friends is a big part of my downtime too, whether it's catching
        up at church on Sundays or just chilling during the week. I'm all about
        learning and staying curious—always up for exploring new tech and
        finding fresh ways to solve problems. Collaboration's key for me; I
        thrive on bouncing ideas around and working with diverse perspectives to
        cook up cool stuff.
